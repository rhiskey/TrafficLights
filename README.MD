Traffic lights

Create an app that can toggle traffic lights. On first start, the color of 
each traffic light must be off. This can be done using the alpha property. 
For example, to set values ​​for a red traffic light, you can set the alpha 
property of your outlet, which is responsible for the red signal, to 0.3 - 
this is the color brightness (transparency) value from 0 to 1.

By pressing the "START" button, the red light should light up, and the 
button title should change its value to "NEXT". Subsequent pressing of the 
"NEXT" button should change the active color to the next one in order. 
Thus, each subsequent click on the "Next" button should sequentially 
change the traffic lights.

Minimum tasks that you must solve:
Prepare the application interface with an eye on all current devices
Make traffic lights round
